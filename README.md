# homie – Publish Listing Page

## Overview

This project is a responsive landing page that allows landlords to publish a rental property listing.

It is part of the **homie** platform concept — a modern, direct-to-tenant rental marketplace focused on simplicity, transparency, and clean design.

The page includes:

* A transparent fixed header
* A two-column hero + form layout
* A property submission form
* Responsive behavior for mobile devices

The project is built using **pure HTML and CSS** (no frameworks).

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This page serves as the "Create Listing" flow where property owners can:

* Add listing title
* Write a property description
* Select property type
* Add location
* Set monthly price
* Upload images

The goal is to provide a frictionless publishing experience with a modern UI.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Google Fonts (Inter)

No JavaScript framework or backend integration is currently included.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
project-folder/
│
├── index.html (or publish.html)
└── README.md
```

All styling is embedded directly inside the `<style>` tag within the HTML file.

---

## 🎨 Design Principles

* Modern gradient background
* Soft shadows and large border radii
* Clean typography (Inter)
* Transparent fixed navigation header
* Clear visual hierarchy
* Mobile-first responsive layout

---

## 📱 Responsiveness

The layout switches from a two-column design (desktop) to a single-column layout (mobile) when the screen width is below 900px.

On smaller devices:

* The info panel becomes simplified
* Padding is adjusted
* The form remains fully usable

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the HTML file in your browser.

No build tools or dependencies are required.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

Possible next steps for development:

* Backend integration (Node.js / Supabase / Firebase)
* Image upload storage
* Form validation
* Google Maps integration for location
* Authentication system
* Database connection for listings
* SEO optimization
